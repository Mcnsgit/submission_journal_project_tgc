                                <h2>Topic: Connecting the stack</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Key Terms
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Client â€” the client is the person or software who uses the API. It can be a
                                        developer, for example
                                        you, as a developer, can use Twitter API to read and write data from Twitter,
                                        create a new tweet
                                        and do more actions in a program that you write. Your program will call
                                        Twitter's API. The client
                                        can also be a web browser. When you go to Twitter website, your browser is the
                                        client who calls
                                        Twitter API and uses the returned data to render information on the screen.</li>
                                    <li>Resource - a resource can be any object the API can provide information about.
                                        In Instagram's API,
                                        for example, a resource can be a user, a photo, a hashtag. Each resource has a
                                        unique identifier.
                                        The identifier can be a name or a number.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>API Requests</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>GET is used to retrieve a resource (information) from the server. This is the
                                        default request
                                        method</li>
                                    <li>POST is used to create a new resource on the server.</li>
                                    <li>PUT is used to update an existing resource on the server.</li>
                                    <li>PATCH is similar to PUT request, the difference is that it only modifies parts
                                        of the content of an
                                        existing resource.</li>
                                    <li>DELETE is used to delete a resource from the server.</li>
                                </ul>

                                            continuous development and customer delivery and uses intervals or sprints.
                                            It also focuses on
                                            Pair Programming.</p>
                                        <h2>Scrum and Sprint</h2>
                                        <p>Scrum team structure involves three distinct roles. The three Scrum roles
                                            are:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Product owner</li>
                                            <li>Scrum master</li>
                                            <li>Development team member</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>These Scrum roles are often different from official job titles, meaning that
                                            the development team,
                                            for example, can be comprised of testers, designers, programmers, and more.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Scrum teams are usually ten or less people.</p>
                                        <p>For Scrum to be effective, there has to be strong communication,
                                            accountability, and collaboration
                                            between team members.</p>
                                        <p>Transparency: Product owners need to be clear and precise about requirements.
                                            The development
                                            team should also be transparent about roadblocks and impediments so they can
                                            be resolved
                                            quickly.</p>
                                        <p>Accountability: Members of the Scrum team are accountable to themselves and
                                            to the delivery of
                                            the final sprint goal.</p>
                                        <p>Self-organization: Every member of the team should understand their role and
                                            responsibilities and
                                            be proactive in problem-solving.</p>
                                        <h3>Meetings</h3>
                                        <p>Scrum team members should understand what role they play and how their
                                            participation in each Scrum
                                            event brings them closer to the sprint goal and overall project goal.</p>
                                        <p>The events and meetings Scrum teams attend are:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Scrum sprint planning meeting occurs before every Scrum sprint.
                                                Determine the goal of the
                                                sprint</li>
                                            <li>Daily stand-up meetings: A short event. Update the rest of the team
                                                about individual
                                                progress and impediments.</li>
                                            <li>Scrum of Scrums meetings: Ideally, one representative from each Scrum
                                                team in the
                                                organization will meet to synchronize efforts, discuss
                                                interdependencies, and inform each
                                                other of potential cross-team impediments.</li>
                                            <li>Sprint review: Review the outcome of the sprint.</li>
                                            <li>Sprint retrospective: Review issues from the previous sprint. This
                                                enables teams to improve
                                                and overcome any process obstacles that proved tricky during the sprint
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
