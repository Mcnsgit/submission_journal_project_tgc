        <h2> Linked in - what should I add to my profile?</h2>
        <p>Think about your technical skills — what could you add in?</p>
        <p>- You can evidence these skills by completing skills assessments and by receiving skill endorsements</p>
        <p>- If you're adding in soft skills, think about the industry and what skills are the most beneficial</p>
        <p>- You can add up to 50 skills, but remember, sometimes less is more</p>
        <p>- For some roles, you can also answer key interview questions to demonstrate your transferable skills</p>

                    <h4> What are apprenticeships?</h4>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> - An apprenticeship is paid job that combines on-the-job experience with classroom
                            learning.</li>
                        <li> - Alongside on the job training, apprentices spend at least 20% of their working hours
                            completing classroom based-learning with a college, university or training provider, leading
                            to a recognised qualification.</li>
                        <li> - You'll be part of the team, like any other employee, but you will get dedicated study
                            time throughout the week too.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Types of Apprenticeships</h3>
                    <p>
                        <bold>Apprenticeships can take 1-5 years to complete depending on their level</bold>
                    <ul>
                        <li> - Level 1-2 - Equivalent to GCSE level</li>
                        <li> - Level 3 - Advanced apprenticeships (equivalent to AS/A levels)</li>
                        <li> - Level 4-7 - Higher apprenticeships (equivalent to foundation degrees and above)</li>
                        <li> - Level 6-7 - Degree apprenticeships (equivalent to undergraduate/masters degrees) </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3> What is off the job training?</h3>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> - Off-the-job training involves developing the essential skills needed to complete your
                            apprenticeship</li>
                        <li> - It is a requirement that 20% of an apprentices paid time is spent off-the-job.</li>
                        <li> - Off-the-job training is delivered by subject experts - this could be theory based,
                            practical based or additional learning support/1-1s</li>
                        <li> - Different employers may have different preferences in how this is carried out - for
                            example in blocks, part of each day or one day a week</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>1. What are apprenticeship salaries like?</h3>
                    <p> Apprenticeship salaries in the UK can vary widely depending on the sector, the level of the
                        apprenticeship, the employer, and the region. Generally, the minimum wage for apprentices is
                        lower than that of regular employees, but many employers pay more than the minimum. As of April
                        2023, the national minimum wage for apprentices is £4.81 per hour for apprentices under 19 or in
                        their first year. For those over 19 and past their first year, the wage aligns with the standard
                        national minimum wage for their age group.
                        In the software development sector, apprentices may earn more than the average across all
                        sectors due to the high demand for tech skills. Salaries can range significantly based on the
                        company, location, and the specific skills being developed. Larger tech companies and those
                        located in major cities like London tend to offer higher wages.</p>
                    <h3>2. What sectors are apprenticeships available in?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Apprenticeships are available in a wide range of sectors in the UK, including but not limited to
                        healthcare, engineering, business, finance, hospitality, retail, and construction. In the realm
                        of software development and IT, apprenticeships are increasingly popular. These can cover areas
                        such as software development, IT support, cyber security, data analysis, and digital marketing.
                        These programs are designed to meet the growing need for skilled professionals in the tech
                        industry.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. Will it cost anything for a learner?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Generally, apprentices do not have to pay for training costs, as these are covered by the
                        employer and the government. Apprentices are considered employees and are paid a salary for
                        their work, which includes time spent training. However, there may be some incidental costs,
                        like travel or work equipment, depending on the employer's policies.
                        For apprenticeships in software development, the same principle applies - the training costs are
                        usually covered by the employer and the government. Given the technical nature of the field,
                        employers might also provide additional resources like software licenses, development tools, or
                        even hardware like laptops.
