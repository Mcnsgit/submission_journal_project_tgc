                <h3>Exploring Career Paths: Entry-level and Apprenticeships</h3>
                <p>Identify junior or entry-level roles by looking for terms like 'trainee', 'junior', or 'graduate'. Seek roles where skills are 'desirable' for a better chance at qualifying.</p>
                <p>Apprenticeships combine work with study to gain skills and a qualification. They can last from 1 to 5 years and cover various levels, from GCSE equivalent up to degree level.</p>
                <p>Off-the-job training is part of apprenticeships, ensuring you learn the necessary skills while working. It's required that 20% of your time is dedicated to this type of training.</p>
                <p><strong>Apprenticeship salaries</strong> vary by sector and level, with many employers paying above the minimum wage. The tech sector, in particular, may offer higher wages due to the demand for skilled professionals.</p>
