            <p> This week we learnt about project development planning and as an exercise created our own project development plan.</p>
                <h2> STAGE 1-THE CONCEPT</h2>
                <p> The first step in project development planning is to develop an idea. This is the most important
                    step in the process. The idea should be something that you are passionate about and that you are
                    willing to put in the time and effort to make it a reality. </p>
                <h3>STAGE 2 - REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                <p>• A specific set of things the app:
                MUST be able to do
                SHOULD be able to do
                COULD be able to do</p>
                <h3>STAGE 2 example</h3>
                <P>
            <Ul><li>app must be able to store scores
            For wide range of archery events</li> 
            <li> The app should be able to track progress
            over time, personal bests, records etc.</li> 

        <li> It would be nice if the app could show
            graphs or charts to show improvement
            over time.</li> </Ul>

        </p>

                            <p> <b>Overview of the Concept</b>

                                The proposed application is a social coding collaboration and sharing platform designed
                                to enhance the way developers interact, learn, and grow together. It aims to bridge the
                                gap between traditional code hosting services and social networks, creating a vibrant
                                community where users can share code snippets, undergo real-time code reviews, and
                                participate in a task marketplace fueled by a unique credit system.
                                Purpose

                                The app is tailored for software developers, ranging from beginners seeking to learn and
                                improve their coding skills to seasoned professionals looking to contribute to the
                                community and collaborate on projects. It serves as a one-stop platform for code
                                sharing, review, and collaborative learning, fostering a supportive environment where
                                developers can showcase their work, receive constructive feedback, and assist one
                                another.
                                Target Audience
