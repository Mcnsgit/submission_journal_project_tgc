                development and information systems. In this website you will find a summary of my learning journey in
                Software Development and some of the projects I created during the course, and others that I have worked on for fun and practice(not all will be finished products just more of a way to sort out my coding "notes" ). The projects so far will be mostly in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </p>
